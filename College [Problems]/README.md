# Follow Up Notes:

#### 347. Top K Frequent Elements 
* To sort a map or unordered_map "hash table" by value:
	* First, Put the keys and values of the map in vector of pairs 
	* Second, Sort the vector by the way:
```
//v is a vector
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), cmp); 
```
```
//comparator lampda-function to sort pairs according to second value
static bool cmp(pair<int, int>& a, pair<int, int>& b) 
{ 
	return a.second < b.second; 
}
```
